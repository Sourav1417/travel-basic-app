# Travel Basic App
ðŸ‘‹Hello All. Myself Sourav Mohanty. I am a Web Developer, Front-end Developer and a Full-Stack Web Developer. \
This is just a basic React app which display some popular tourist places along with it's travel price, description and image. \
Users can click onthe Not Interested button for that destination plan which they don't like and that destination place will get removed from the list of other destinations. \
This is very basic React app developed for understanding the useState() hook of React. Anyone can develop this for fun. \
